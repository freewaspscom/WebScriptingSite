      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm Jaden, a computer science student at Lake Land College. I am primarily here for developing applications for desktop computers, though game development is a secondary hobby of mine that I would like to study as well. I really enjoy open-source software, and hope to contribute to a project that I enjoy someday soon.</p>
      <p>Music is a big passion of mine. I have been playing music in my school's band since 5th grade, and I have never stopped since. By 9th grade, I was starting to look into writing music of my own, and I have wrote many songs of my own in the past few years. I got my start playing the alto saxophone, and recently I have picked up the bass guitar.</p>

          <h3>FireTracker</h3>
          <p>I hope to make my own music program someday that will fix the problems I have with all the software I currently use. I vastly prefer to use what is known as a tracker, a style of music program that is sort of like a spreadsheet, which makes my options very slim. With FireTracker, I mostly hope to adapt an existing tracker to fit my needs better, such as OpenMPT or MadTracker. Both of those are functional, but they feel too clunky to use.</p>

          <h3>Desktop Enhancements</h3>
          <p>I use Arch Linux and the KDE Desktop Environment, and, while I like both of them a lot, there are some things that I wish it had. For a while, I had a setup with a Taskbar panel, similar to how Windows is set up, with a secondary panel that I could pop up whenever I wanted to access secondary functions that I used, but not as often. I later found out that I was exploiting a bug when I set that up, and that bug has since been patched. Sometime soon, I hope to find a way around that, or, in the most extreme case, that I can successfully create a program that can replicate the feature.</p>
